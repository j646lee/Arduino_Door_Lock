# Arduino_Door_Lock
This is a Arduino-powered smart door lock system using a keypad to enhance user experience
This repository implements an **Arduino-based Smart Door Lock** system using a 4x4 keypad and servo motor.  
The project demonstrates the integration of embedded hardware and software to create a secure, low-cost, and customizable access control solution.  

The system allows users to unlock a door by entering a predefined PIN on the keypad. Incorrect attempts trigger a security mechanism with lockout cooldowns, preventing brute-force entry.  
With optional support for Wi-Fi modules (ESP8266/ESP32), the design can be extended into an **IoT-enabled smart lock** capable of remote monitoring and event logging.  

This project was developed as part of a personal initiative to explore embedded systems, IoT, and hardware prototyping. It serves as both a practical security prototype and a learning platform for microcontroller programming, circuit design, and modular code development.
