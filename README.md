# Arduino_Door_Lock
This is a Arduino-powered smart door lock system using a keypad to enhance user experience.


This Arduino-powered electronic door lock project demonstrates the implementation of embedded hardware and software integrated in order to create a secure, lows cost, and customizable user experience. The system permits users to unlock the smart door lock by entering a desired predefined 4 digit PIN with the help of the 4x4 keyapd. On of the off chances that a user inputs the wrong set of digits, it will trigger a security mechanism with a louckout feature preventing brute force entry. Additionally the system permits users to update their passwords on the spot without the need to alter the code, as long as they are able to pass the verification process of inputting their most current 4 digit PIN code.
